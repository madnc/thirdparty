This is OpenCV 2.4.3, downloaded from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.3/OpenCV-2.4.3.tar.bz2

To make it compile for 10.4, I had to replace kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA with 'BGRA' in modules/highgui/src/cap_qtkit.mm.

32-bits build made on Leopard:
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
mkdir build32 dest32
cd build32
cmake .. -DWITH_CARBON=ON -DWITH_COCOA=OFF -DBUILD_ZLIB=OFF -DPYTHON_USE_NUMPY=OFF -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;ppc" -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4 -DWITH_CUDA=OFF -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF
make
make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/../dest32

64-bits build made on Lion:
mkdir build64 dest64
cd build64
cmake .. -DWITH_CARBON=OFF -DWITH_COCOA=ON -DBUILD_ZLIB=OFF -DPYTHON_USE_NUMPY=OFF -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64" -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 -DWITH_CUDA=OFF -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF
make
make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/../dest64

Libraries were then combined using lipo (remember to keep symlinks intact).  install_name_tool has to be used to fix the 'lib/' prefix for the libraries.

I deleted the libraries we don't need so that we don't bloat the distribution too much.
Only highgui and its dependencies (imgproc, core) were kept.
