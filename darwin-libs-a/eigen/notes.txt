This is Eigen 3.2.4, downloaded from:
http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.2.4.tar.bz2

No need to compile, since this is a template library.
Just copy over the Eigen directory.

Eigen is mostly MPL2, and MPL2 or more permissive when compiled
with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol.  See COPYING.README.
